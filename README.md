horse-race
=============

A simple Java board game.

---

This is a simple Java board game in which players compete to win a race. Players (2 to 6) take turns rolling the dice to see their corresponding horse move around the track. The fields in which the horses land may have penalties (move the horse backwards) or bonuses (move the horse forward). For the finish line, the number rolled on the dice needs to match the number of fields remaining exactly, otherwise, the player loses his turn.

+ The implementation is based on the description given in: [http://www.misteriojuvenil.com/regras/corrida_cavalos.pdf]().
+ Internationalization is still to be done.
